<li> For Daramolas project, we picked a person with an interesting story growing up and an interesting life in general. We interviewed our person with eight questions that were assigned to us and we had to think of two more questions. 
After we recored a voice recording of our interview, we had to type a transcript of our interview. After we were done with the interview portion of the project, we used scribble maps to locate all the places that were mentioned
in the interview.
