<text> For this project we had to do a total of two projects where the first on we had the theme of coding the past where we picked someone that we knew had an interesting life growing up. In history and english class, we did different projects with the one topic, Coding the past. the projects consisted of interviewing someones past and current life and making a map of the places they mention in there interview. The project also included making a collage of different images representing our persons life and also writing an essay on one topic they mention in the interview. The second project we did was a timely soulution based on the time era of the industrial revolution. For history we picked a invention that was produced in that time period and we made an annotated biblioghraphy, a press release using google slides, a model of our invention, and a sketch of the model.
